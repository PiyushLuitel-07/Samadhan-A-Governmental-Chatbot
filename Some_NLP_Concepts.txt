Word Embedding -->> converting words into vectors(collection of numbers) so that we can apply ML algos on them

WORD2vec -->> 
A deep learning algorithm
A word embedding technique
developed by goggle engineers
can capture semantic meaning of words
vectors are of low dimension(reperesents word in 300 dimension) so storage efficent and easy to handle
it provides dense vectors
